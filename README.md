# I will always remember this day.
I was a newbie in programming (and I still consider a newbie as when I am writing this message).
But after a year of hard work I was successfully to qualified to work as an engineer.
Life is full of surprises and I have never thought I could get this far.
Hope you, if you are reading this message, 
continue to work through your ways to explore coding and may your goals come true.
Do not fear your life, you can be whoever you want to be!
